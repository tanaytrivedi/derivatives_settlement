# OTC Derivatives Settlement Network

> The OTC Derivatives Network allows buyers and seller of Over-the-Counter derivatives to settle contracts without transactional fees in a private, permissioned manner.

This business network defines:

**Participants**
`Administrator` `Trader`

**Assets**
`OpenOrders` `LiveContracts` `Underlyings`

**Transactions**

The `PublishOrder` transaction submitted by two `Trader` participants will at the end of the trading day be paired to create a `LiveContract`.
